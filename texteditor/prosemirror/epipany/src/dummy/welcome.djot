# Welcome to Epiphany

Epiphany is an open-source note-taking app that draws inspiration from Notion. I created Epiphany on a whim because I wanted a platform to document my AI learning journey. After researching various options such as Medium, dev.to, and Substack, I found that they were not suitable for technical writing. Additionally, blogging platforms come and go, and I didn't want to risk losing my content due to platform shutdowns or migrations. With Epiphany, I have complete control over my content, and I don't have to worry about losing it. I can easily export my data in open formats and use it in other applications.

I also considered static site generators, but I found that editing raw markdown files was less than ideal, particularly when it came to previewing math equations. With Epiphany, you have the best of both worlds: a user-friendly interface for organizing and taking notes, the ability to save your data in open formats and publish them as a blog.

As someone who has started and abandoned many projects, I'm committed to keeping Epiphany alive and improving it over time. I use it as my sole note-taking app and believe that it can be a valuable tool for others as well.
